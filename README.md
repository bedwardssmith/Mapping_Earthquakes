<h1>Mapping Earthquakes</h1>
<h2>Overview of Project</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitude of earthquakes throughout the world.  GeoJSON earthquake data was used from the USGS website.  Javascript and the D3.js library is used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitues of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.  The Leaflet library is then used to plot the data on a Mapbox map.</p>
<h2>Overlay</h2>
<p>The overlay feature is used allowing the user to choose between the options available; all earthquakes, tectonic plate, major earthquakes, and major earthquakes over the past 30 days.</p>
