<h1>Mapping Earthquakes</h1>
<h2>Overview of Project</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitude of earthquakes throughout the world.  GeoJSON earthquake data was used from the USGS website.  Javascript and the D3.js library is used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitues of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.  The Leaflet library is then used to plot the data on a Mapbox map.</p>
<h2>Overlay</h2>
<p>The overlay feature is used allowing the user to choose between the options available; all earthquakes, tectonic plate, major earthquakes, and major earthquakes over the past 30 days.</p>

<h2>Street and Satellite Views</h2>
  <p>Views are avaialble by either street view or satellite view.</p> 
  <h3>Street View</h3>

  <h2>Tectonic Plates</h2>
  <p>The tectonic plate overlay shows the location of the tectonic plates worldwide.</p>

  <h2>Major Earthquakes Past 7 Days</h2>
  <p>The major earthquakes overlay shows the mapping of majory earthquakes that have occurred in the past 7 days worlwide.  The size of the circles are relative
    to the size of the earthquake and the color references the legend.  The size and location of the earthquake are displayed when the user clicks on a circle.</p>

  <h2>Major Earthquakes Past 30 Days</h2>
  <p>The final overlay reflects major earthquakes that have occurred in the past 30 days worldwide.  As with the 7 day overlay the size of the circles are relative tot he size of the earthquake and the color references the legend.  The size and location of the earthquake are displayed when the user clicks on a circle.</p>
